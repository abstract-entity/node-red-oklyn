    npm install node-red-contrib-oklyn

# Flow example
Link below show you an implementation of each oklyn node with manual trigger

## [Flow example](examples/example.json)
<br />

# API Usage
## Configuration
To find your api key follow this steps:
1.  Open your Oklyn mobile app, and go to 'my account'
2.  Open 'API Access' at the bottom of page
3.  Activate API access
4.  Copy your API key

![api-key-conf](images/oklyn-api.png "Find your API key")

To add your api key in node-red configuration:
1. Drag any oklyn node in your flow panel
2. Double click the node
3. For the 'Config' property select 'Add new oklyn-config', then click the 'edit pen'
4. Paste your API key in 'Api key' peroperty, then click add

## List devices
**Configuration**
- Name (optionnal): Name to display for the node
- Config (required): Oklyn api key to use for the call
